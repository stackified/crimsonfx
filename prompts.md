## Design Notes
- All images must use TradeLocker's dark theme (black background)
- Primary color is vibrant blue (#1863DC) for main UI elements and CTAs
- Accent color is light blue-gray (#B6BECC) for secondary elements and text
- Maintain consistent visual style across all images
- Focus on modern, minimalist, tech-oriented UI/UX design
- Use clean typography (Euclid Square or Inter style fonts if visible)
- Ensure high contrast for readability on dark backgrounds
- Professional, next-gen trading platform aesthetic
- **Feature card images**: Will be used as background images with white gradient overlays, so ensure the design works well when partially obscured and at low opacity (10-15%)
- **Geometric design language**: Incorporate minimalist geometric shapes inspired by TradeLocker's logo - bracket-like forms, clamp shapes, horizontal bars with squared ends, elements suggesting structure, containment, framing, security, and balance. Use these geometric elements subtly throughout the designs for visual cohesion with the brand identity.
